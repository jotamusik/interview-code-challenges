# Martian Robots

This kata is specified in [instructions](./instructions.md).

## How to

In order to make the code work, you have to run `npm install` from __martian-robots__ folder.

If you just want to run the tests, you can do it by `npm run test`. The tests are made using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

The entry point of the game is `MartianRobotsGame.js` where ___MartianRobotsGame___ function is 
defined. That function will receive the input as a string so, if you have the input on a file, you 
should read the file before passing the input to the function. The output of the function will be 
a string as well.
